## Hello! I'm Gabriel 

I'm a scientist and developer living in Edinburgh. 

When I'm not at my computer, I am running, climbing, hiking, cycling, knitting or who knows where else! 

I recently completed a PhD in Electron Microscopy, with additional background in Biochemistry and Structural Biology.


### Notable Projects

 - [SimpliPyTEM](https://github.com/gabriel-ing/SimpliPyTEM) - A Python library for processing and analysing electron microscopy images and movies. 

 - [EM_calculations](https://github.com/gabriel-ing/EM_calculations) and [CTF_sim](https://github.com/gabriel-ing/CTF_sim) - Python Scripts and notebooks for calculating and simulating various concepts within electron microscopy (including the Contrast Transfer Function). EM_calculations mainly contains methods I used to create figures for my thesis.

 - [ProjectSanMarino](https://github.com/gabriel-ing/ProjectSanMarino) - A Python-based exercise challenge using data from Strava API.

 - [Yahtzee_Java](https://github.com/gabriel-ing/Yahtzee_Java) - A Java app implementation of the dice game Java, created to re-familiarise myself with Java (But its a fun game, check it out!)
